# Zoomdata Oauth/ClientId Builder Tool

A very simple Zoomdata Node Application that will send credentials and retrieve the appropriate Oauth Token and Websocket Client ID from the server.

## To Run

Install node, and execute `npm install`. From here just run the node express server (`npm start` in `bin/www`) and go to localhost:3000 to fill in the requested credentials.
